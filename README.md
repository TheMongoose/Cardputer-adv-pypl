# Cardputer-adv-pypl
A simple python repl system for those who want to figure out how to use the keyboard and run small python scripts on it
# How to install
I have worked three days the get this keyboard demo up and running for people to use and it it good for a simple repl if you want to use it.  
*First:*  
  
you *DO NOT* install the cardputer circutpython software but the m5 stack Stamps3 [The link to the software](https://circuitpython.org/board/m5stack_stamp_s3/)  
  
then just copy and replace all of the files, **Thats it!**  
  
Enjoy!
